# BlaBlaCart (work in progress)
A simple shopping web-app for a premium footware company.

# Important information

1. Please view main.scss and utility-styles.scss for the styling
2. modal-script.js has the JavaScript for all the modals in the web-app.
3. cart.js/ wishlist.js has the JavaScript for the cart and wishlist sections in the web-app.
4. GeoLocation.js is the file for geolocation API
5. Pexels API has the script directly written within trending.html
# 6. script.js is still under work and will be the only .js(for cart and wishlist) file after 100% completion.

script.js has intensive application of IIFEs and closures and will take time to develop entirely.
