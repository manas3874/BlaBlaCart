# BlaBlaCart (work in progress)
A simple shopping web-app for a premium footware company.

# Important information

1. Please view main.scss and utility-styles.scss for the styling
2. modal-script.js has the JavaScript for all the modals in the web-app.
3. cart.js/ wishlist.js has the JavaScript for the cart and wishlist sections in the web-app.
4. GeoLocation.js is the file for geolocation API
5. Pexels API has the script directly written within trending.html
6. script.js is still under work and will be the only .js(for cart and wishlist) file after 100% completion.

script.js has intensive application of IIFEs and closures and will take time to develop entirely.
